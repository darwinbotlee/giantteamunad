                        <h2>Gutierrez Wins His 6th Colombian DH Title!</h2>
                        <aside>
                            Giant Factory Off-Road Team rider Marcelo Gutierrez returned to his home country last weekend to race the 2016 Colombia National Downhill Championship in Yarumal. And for the sixth time in his career, Gutierrez earned the right to wear yellow-blue-and-red striped jersey of the Colombian national champion.<br/><br/>

                            “I couldn’t be happier about getting back my country’s colors,” Gutierrez said after his win. “It feels great to be the national champion for the sixth time.”<br/><br/>

                            Facing tough, constantly changing conditions on the DH track in the mountainous village of Yarumal, located in the central northwestern region of Colombia not far from the Caribbean Sea, Gutierrez took the win on his Glory Advanced 27.5 team bike.<br/><br/>

                            “It was an interesting and challenging race,” Gutierrez said. “Race day started out sunny and looked promising, but the weather was unpredictable and we ended up racing in the rain. That plus the jetlag coming from Australia [site of the last World Cup round] made it tough, but I’m proud to have done well in the tough conditions.”<br/><br/>

                        <h2>Double Podium for Giant at Sea Otter DH!</h2>
                        <aside>
                            Giant Factory Off-Road Team riders wrapped up their weekend at the Sea Otter Classic in Monterey, California, with two more podium finishes in Sunday’s elite men’s downhill event.<br/><br/>

                            Marcelo Gutierrez finished third and Josh Carlson finished fourth, both racing on Reign Advanced bikes. The elite men's DH was won by BMXer Mike Day, riding as a privateer on a Giant Trance Advanced 27.5. <br/><br/>

                            “A race is a race no matter what,” Gutierrez said after putting in a strong run on a track that’s shorter and less technical than the World Cup tracks he’s more accustomed to. “I’m glad I tried hard all week and managed to make the podium in the downhill. It was a proper effort on that track, which is short but good. It’s intense. The simplicity of it makes it hard to have a clean run.”<br/><br/>

                            Gutierrez, who also finished seventh in the dual slalom event, experimented with a few different Giant bikes for the DH before ultimately choosing to race his Reign Advanced.<br/><br/>

                            “I’m stoked with how the bike felt for this race,” Gutierrez said. “Quick, efficient and agile. The Reign Advanced is the perfect combination for this kind of track, it made me feel more confident going into corners and in general.”<br/><br/>

                            Carlson’s fourth-place finish in the DH capped a successful few days of racing at the Laguna Seca Recreation Area.<br/><br/>

                            “Backing up my enduro podium with a podium in the DH was awesome,” Carlson said. “I pieced together a great run with minimal mistakes and felt great. I raced my Reign in full Enduro World Series spec and it performed great. I’m really happy to come away from Sea Otter with two podiums and had a great week with everyone who came out to enjoy the festival.”<br/><br/>

                            Also representing Giant in the elite men's DH were McKay Vezina finishing 12th. <br/><br/>

                        <h2>Giant Enduro Riders Storm Sea Otter Podium!</h2>
                        <aside>
                            The Giant Factory Off-Road Team stormed the enduro event at the Sea Otter Classic Thursday in Monterey, California, taking two podium spots and putting five riders in the top-10 of the elite men’s race.<br/><br/>

                            Australian Josh Carlson led the way, racing his Anthem Advanced bike to a second-place finish behind fellow Aussie Jared Graves.<br/><br/>

                            “The Sea Otter enduro is always a super tough race,” Carlson said. “The stages are quite simple but it’s hard to piece together four perfect stages. I was stoked with how I performed today and really happy to come away with second place.”<br/><br/>

                            The Sea Otter enduro follows an unusual format, with one run of the downhill course, one of the dual slalom, and more pedaling than the typical courses seen on Enduro World Series style terrain. Giant riders chose the appropriate bikes and gear to get the best results. Carlson’s teammate Yoann Barelli also rode an Anthem Advanced, finishing fourth, and Colombian Marcelo Gutierrez, more of a DH specialist, rode a Trance Advanced trail bike to finish sixth. Two other Giant riders, McKay Vezina and Seamus Powell, finished 7th and 10th respectively. <br/><br/>

                            “I rode my Anthem Advanced with a 120mm RockShox Pike fork,” Carlson said. “Schwalbe Nobby Nic front tire and Rock Razor in the rear was perfect for the Sea Otter dirt. With such pedally tracks I went up to a 38T SRAM front chainring to help with sprinting and pedaling. There was lots of Tokyo drift action out there, it felt good to have full confidence in my bike and setup.”<br/><br/>

                            Carlson also wore the new Giant Rail helmet and Charge shoes to land the podium. <br/><br/>

                            Race action continues at the Sea Otter Classic through the weekend. <br/><br/>
